# üå°Ô∏è Weather Prediction Project (MVP 1)

This project uses Machine Learning to predict the mean temperature in London based on weather-related variables such as cloud cover, global radiation, precipitation, pressure, among others.

## üéØ Objective

To build and compare regression models to predict the mean temperature (`mean_temp`) and evaluate their performance using MLflow for experiment tracking.

---

## üß± Models Trained

- `LinearRegression` (without hyperparameter tuning).
- `DecisionTreeRegressor` (hyperparameter tuning via RandomizedSearchCV).
- `RandomForestRegressor` (hyperparameter tuning via RandomizedSearchCV).

---

## üß™ Main Metric

- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)** on the test set (`rmse_test`).
- Additionally logged:
  - `rmse_train`: Training error or cross-validation score.
  - `rmse_gap`: Difference between test and train RMSE (to monitor overfitting).

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run the Project

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Train models and log experiments:

```bash
python train.py
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Analyze results, export to CSV, and plot:

```bash
python analyze_results.py
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Load the best model and make predictions:

```bash
python load_best_model.py
```

---

## üìä Results

The results are saved in `experiment_results.csv`. The best-performing models can also be visualized using the plot generated by `analyze_results.py`.

Example of expected output:

| Model              | RMSE Train | RMSE Test | RMSE Gap |
|--------------------|------------|-----------|----------|
| RandomForest       | 2.56       | 2.85      | 0.29     |
| DecisionTree       | 3.10       | 3.76      | 0.66     |
| LinearRegression   | 4.98       | 5.12      | 0.14     |

## üöÄ Next Steps (MVP 2, 3, and 4)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This MVP represents the first phase of the project. The following improvements are planned:

- **MVP 2:** Technical deep dive (new models, better hyperparameter optimization).
- **MVP 3:** Deployment as a prediction API (FastAPI or MLflow models serve).
- **MVP 4:** Model registration in MLflow Registry with versioning and staging/production/archive management.
